Title:

				“Data-Driven Sales Optimization for Textile/Wholesale Distribution”		


KPI Measures:

1\. **Sales Concentration Index (SCI)**

Description :

The Sales Concentration Index (SCI) measures how much of the total sales comes from the top customers.
A high SCI indicates that a large portion of revenue is generated by only a few retailers, creating dependency risk.
This KPI helps the business understand whether sales are evenly distributed or heavily reliant on key buyers.

Shows dependency on a handful of customers.



**SCI = Sales from Top 5 Customer / Total Sales**



2\. Top retailers based on sales/each region

Description:

This KPI ranks the highest-performing retailers within each state or region.
It highlights which areas contribute the most revenue and which need attention.
Useful for targeting sales efforts and planning region-wise strategies.


3. **Product Contribution Margin (%)**

Description:

This measures how much profit each product generates after deducting costs.
A higher margin means the product contributes more to business earnings.
It helps identify profitable designs and remove low-value or loss-making items.


**Contribution Margin = ((Sales − Cost) / Sales) * 100**

4. **Sales Growth Momentum (SGM)**

Description:

SGM tracks how quickly sales are increasing or decreasing month-to-month.
Positive growth shows improving business performance, while negative growth signals issues.
It helps measure short-term trends and the impact of marketing, seasonality, or demand changes.


**SGM = ((Current Month Sales − Previous Month Sales) / Previous Month Sales) * 100**



  Shows how quickly you're growing.


5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) (Simple Version)** (Retailer KPI)

Description:

CLV estimates how much revenue a retailer brings over the entire relationship.
It combines order value, frequency, and active months to measure long-term importance.
This helps the business focus on high-value retailers who contribute consistent sales.


**CLV = Avg Order Value × Orders per Month × Retention Months** (order placed month not all months)

	

	1.) **AOV** =  Total Sales​ / Total Orders 

	2.) **orders per mon** = Total orders / active months

		**(active months = (Last Order Date – First Order Date) / 30)**

	3.) Retention month :

		**Retention Months =**

                            **CALCULATE(**

                              **DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders\[OrderMonth]),**

                              **ALLEXCEPT(Orders, Orders\[Retailer])**

                            **)**

 Shows long-term revenue from each retailer.



6\. **Sales by Region/State**

Description:

This KPI shows total sales generated by each region or state.
It helps identify strong markets and regions where sales are weak or declining.
Useful for planning inventory, logistics, and region-specific promotions.



&nbsp;	**SUM(Sales Amount) grouped by Region**


Helps identify strong/weak regions



7\. **Repeat Purchase Rate(%)**

Description:

RPR measures how many retailers return to place more than one order.
A higher rate means stronger customer loyalty and better business health.
It helps track customer retention and identify gaps in service or product appeal.

  **Repeat Purchase Rate (%) = ((Number of retailers with > 1 order) / Total number of retailers)) ​× 100**

Chalenges faced by the textiles/wholesale industry:


The wholesale textile industry in India is currently facing strong competition and rapid market changes. Retailers today have access to multiple suppliers, both locally and across different states, which makes customer retention more difficult. Product designs change frequently, and demand patterns shift quickly based on festivals, seasons, and regional preferences.
Because of this, wholesalers must closely track customer buying behavior, best-selling products, slow-moving inventory, and regional sales trends. Additionally, increasing price sensitivity, credit-based transactions, and logistic challenges add more pressure on businesses to operate efficiently.
In this environment, data-driven decision-making has become essential to maintaining sales stability, improving customer loyalty, and optimizing overall business performance.


1.) Customers do not place regular repeat orders due to heavy competition.

2.)  Market saturation:  multiple wholesalers selling the same designs.

3.)  Very wide product range → difficult to identify which designs perform  well.

4.) Delayed payments from retailers affect cash flow.

5.) Delivery delays push customers to choose other suppliers

6.) Hard to maintain loyalty because textile products have many alternatives.
